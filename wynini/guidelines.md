Symbol tables

* Symbol 0 must be config.epsilon (as required by OpenFst/pywrapfst).

* By convention, symbols 1 and 2 are config.bos (beginning-of-string) and config.eos (end-of-string), respectively.

* These conventions apply to all machines, including those created by 'encoding' input/output labels as single symbols.
